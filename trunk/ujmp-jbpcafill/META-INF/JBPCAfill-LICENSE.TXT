[JBPCAfill] Missing Value Estimator for Java
Shigeyuki Oba

BPCAfill is a missing value estimation software suitable for gene expression profile data. (DNA microarray)

BPCAfill estimates missing values in the gene expression matrix, and fill them by the estimated values. The estimation almost always exhibits the best accuracy of all existing methods (as long as I know in 2003). Especially, when your data set has large number of genes and/or large number of samples, BPCAfill will efficiently use all the provided informations and output the best result, even when there are large number of missing entries.

In addition, it is very easy to use, because it do not need any type of hand tuning parameters.
